            Bangladesh is administratively divided into 8 divisions: Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barishal, Sylhet, Mymensingh, and Rangpur. Each division is further subdivided into districts, with a total of 64 districts across the country. These districts are then divided into upazilas (sub-districts) and unions, which handle local administration and services. This structure helps manage the country's diverse regions and ensure effective governance.

        Bangladesh, located in South Asia, is a vibrant and culturally rich country bordered by India,
             Myanmar, and the Bay of Bengal. With a population exceeding 170 million people,
              it is one of the most densely populated nations in the world. The capital city, Dhaka, serves as
               the economic and cultural hub. Gaining independence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh has since
                made notable strides in economic development, particularly in the textile industry. The country 
                is known for its rich cultural heritage, including its literary traditions, festivals like 
                Pohela Boishakh, and its diverse cuisine. Despite facing challenges such as climate change and 
                poverty, Bangladesh continues to show resilience and growth, making significant contributions to
                 global trade and culture.
